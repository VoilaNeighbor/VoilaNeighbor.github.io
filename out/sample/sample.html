  <h1>Automate the Process of Posting a Blog</h1>

  <p>
    In the <a href="./Setting%20up%20a%20Blog%20Site.md">last blog</a>, I set up
    a very crude blog site, with just a simple page exported from Notion. Now,
    I'm adding essential features so that I could update my blogs without going
    back to a Notion draft.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are endless possibilities for a blog site. For editing, I could
    introduce beasts into play such as <em>editor.js</em>, <em>Monaco</em> or
    <em>Code Mirror</em>. For styling, I could introduce existing component
    libraries like <em>Material UI</em>. For content scripting, I might set up
    a backend server, which involves more than domain configuration and network
    issuesâ€¦ I still remember that I am learning to take small steps on the
    happy path to gain confidence; so no, not those fancy things, at least for
    now.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core of automating blog posts is the separation between the
    blog source and how it's presented. To do this, I need a custom compiler. The
    compiler should cut short paths tailored to my needs, otherwise, it won't be
    any better than off-the-shelf solutions.

    A Handmade Prototype as Reference

  <p>
    The other day, I shared this concern to a friend: how do you test drive frontend
    development efficiently? We need humans to check if the visuals are correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    My friend, working at a big tech company, raised her eyebrow: "Nope. It's
    actually straight forward. We have specialist UX designers working on
    requirement documents, so we always have a concrete criterion to meet."
  </p>

  <p>
    Something I overlooked before was that analysis and designing are arts of their
    own. Even in agile development, a terse design document is still better than
    nothing. This applies to personal projects, as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, the prototyping procedure is as simple as opening a local HTML draft
    in the browser and toy with the styles.
